# Introduction to Automatic Control Theory

Automatic Control Theory is a branch of engineering and mathematics focused on the behavior of dynamic systems and the use of feedback to modify system performance. It plays a crucial role in modern technology, allowing machines and processes to operate without constant human intervention.

At its core, control theory deals with the design of systems that can maintain desired outputs despite disturbances or uncertainties. Examples include cruise control in vehicles, temperature regulation in air conditioners, and robotic motion control.

Control systems can be classified into two main types:
- **Open-loop control systems** – systems that act based on pre-set conditions without feedback.
- **Closed-loop control systems** (or feedback control systems) – systems that adjust their actions based on feedback from the output.

Understanding and applying control theory allows engineers to build stable, efficient, and reliable systems across various industries such as aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, and robotics.
